We enjoyed the aspect of creating the game with our twist and take and making it exicting as well as challenging. 
By adding power ups for the game can either bless a player with extra points or anniliate the player's current score to their downfall.
This type of play style gives the player attentive skills and awareness of deciding their fate. The journey we took was pretty rocky, 
However our enjoyment for making this project and its results gives satisfaction of the hard work that was put in. We could 
not add any more power ups such as a speed since we could'nt figure out a way to set a duration. We plan to continue to work on 
this project to further upgrade the way the game "snake" is played originally.
