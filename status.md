#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created the basic snake game so far

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to add the poison apple and golden apple.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am not sure how to randomize the golden apple so that it does not show up everytime the snake eats some food.
